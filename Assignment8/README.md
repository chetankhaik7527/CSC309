## Assignment 6
Due 11/14


Start with the Maze Chase example in Chapter 5.

Modify it so that instead of pressing buttons to move, you tilt the phone in the appropriate direction


Note: While checking in the lab, it looks like the virtual accelerometer is not necessarily working.  If you are working on a real phone or you can access the virtual accelerometer in the emulator, you don't need GenSensor2. But if you need it, first connect to the virtual device (the default settings will work in most cases) and thenuse the Mag/Accel tab to cause the virtual phone to respond to tilting events.
