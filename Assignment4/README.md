## Assignment 4
Due 9/26

Create a conversion app that uses fragments. One fragment should list the available conversions, and the other will allow the user to enter a value and display the converted value. Both fragments should be displayed in landscape orientation, while in portrait orientation the available conversions will be listed, and when the user selects a conversion the conversion screen will be displayed.

For this app, we will support three different conversions:

* Miles to kilometers (1 miles = 1.60934 km)
* Pounds to kilograms (1 pound = 0.453592 kg)
* Radians to degrees (1 radian = 57.2958 degrees)
