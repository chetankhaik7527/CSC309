## Assignment 6
Due 11/9

Create a paint-by-numbers app.

The app should have one or more images, and a set of colors the user can select from.  The user will select a color, then one or more places on the image.

For each place they touch in the image, use flood fill to fill that entire section with the specified color.

The user should be able to recolor each part of the image if they want.  For example, if the initial image is:

![uncolored](image1.png)

then the user might choose to color it:

![colored](image2.png)

The app should work something like this [example](https://www.thecolor.com/Coloring/Baby-Duck.aspx).
