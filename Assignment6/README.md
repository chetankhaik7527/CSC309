## Assignment 6
Due 10/31

Create an app that will calculate the [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) in a background thread and display it.  Add colors using the escape time algorithm (about halfway down the Wikipedia page, also you want to reuse colors after 10-100 iterations) . 

Your app should have buttons to:
* Zoom in or out by 2x
* Move center left, right, up, and down by half the size of the current screen

Include at least five tests in your project.
