## Assignment 1
Due 8/31

Create an app to calculate the taxes due to the Tisroc of Calormen.  Tax rates are as follows:
* Income below or equal to $10,000
    * Tax due is 70% of the income
* Income above $10,000, but below or equal to $100,000
    * Tax due is $7,000 plus 90% of the amount over $10,000
* Income above $100,000
    * Tax due is $88,000 plus 110% of the amount over $100,000

Examples:

| Income   | Tax Due  |
| -------- | -------- |
| $6,000   | $4,700   |
| $60,000  | $52,000  |
| $600,000 | $638,000 |

Your app should have a place for the user to enter their income and a button to calculate and display the tax due.  The tax due should be formatted with two decimal places.

**Note**: Since we haven't discussed handling orientation changes yet, you do not have to worry about them for this assignment.
